More importantly, simple language helps the reader retain information and more readily understand concepts.

### Present Tense

Users read documentation to perform tasks or gather information. For users, these activities take place in their present, so the present tense is proper in most cases. Additionally, the present tense is simpler to read than the past or future tense.

### Voice

Use the active voice whenever possible. The active voice is usually more direct and vigorous than the passive. When you write a sentence in the active voice, it is also usually shorter than in the passive voice. 

Address the user when creating text content, use the noun, you. Use, we, when providing the user with recommendations. We want to take ownership of the guidance we provide, so avoid hiding using ‚Äúit is recommended.‚Äù

### Ableist Language

Don't use ableist language. This avoids biases and harm when discussing disability and accessibility. Ableist language includes words or phrases such as crazy, insane, blind to or blind eye to, cripple, dumb, and others. This also includes action verbs with physical traits, such as jump and run. Choose alternative words depending on the context.

### Acronyms

Although some acronyms are widely understood and preferred to the spelled-out term, others are not well known or are familiar only to a specific group of customers. Define the acronym first. 

### Gender

Use gender-neutral pronouns. Avoid the following nouns he, him, his, she, or her as gender-neutral pronouns. The same applies to he/she or (s)he or other such punctuational approaches. Use the singular they.

### Headline Style

Use title case for headings.  If the heading is conceptual or non-task based, then start with a noun. Avoid using a noun that starts with an -ing.
